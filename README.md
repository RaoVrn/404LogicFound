## 📘 Overview

**404LogicFound** is a curated collection of my daily practice in **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** using **C++**. This isn't just code — it's a complete **learning journey**:

- 🚀 Built from scratch with real logic
- ✅ Tested with edge & custom cases
- 💬 Explained via meaningful comments
- 📈 Committed with clean version history
